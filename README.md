# Login-Maps-Places-Reminder
A functional app that can remind you to do something when you are physically in that area. 
You first set the reminder text and the desired area and then you receive a notification when you physically entered the geofence.
It uses google maps API, Geofences, etc.
Written for Android/Kotlin in MVVM architecture. 
There is still some testing of the viewModel that I need to implement.
